# Network-sniffer-project-
Network sniffer task 

I’m excited to share that I’ve completed my first project as part of my internship at CodeAlpha – a Network Packet Sniffer built using Python and Scapy.

This tool captures real-time network traffic, analyzes Ethernet, IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP, ARP, and even raw data—similar to how Wireshark works. It was a great hands-on experience working with packet-level data, understanding protocols, and enhancing my skills in network security and packet analysis.

What I Learned:

● Deep dive into how data flows through a network.

●Using Scapy to build custom sniffing tools.

●Parsing different layers (Ethernet, IP, TCP/UDP, etc.).

●Comparing my tool’s output with Wireshark for validation.

●The importance of low-level network monitoring in cybersecurity.
